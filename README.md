# Code-from-Helping-Others

As someone known for data analysis coding I often get asked for help. Usually this just means a glance at some slightly incorrect code which I can easily fix. Occasionally when I'm lucky I get asked something that requires me to write quite a bit of code.

I'm always happy to be given a challenge to test and expand my coding skills. Above are some examples of the code I've written to help other people with odd jobs and tasks.


Please note - I only really do this for work colleagues!
